# Learning About Version Control

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

The thing I like the most about version control is that it allows you to keep a comprehensive history of your project and step back when things go wrong. The thing I don't like is that in order to be able to do this, you have to remember to constantly commit and push to save your progress.
